REMOVE DUPLICATES FROM XLS 
For one project, I needed to remove all the duplicates in an XLS sheet to make sure I wasn't sending emails to the same person for an email campaign.

Run in your terminal.



CONVERT XLS DATA TO JSON DATA
Wanted to put up data into my Firestore/Firebase. Firestore takes in a whole file. Using the Firesbase-CLI (https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) I uploaded my converted data.


You can see the json to firestore .js file in this repo too.
